I am so excited to be in Lisbon. By the end of my 6 weeks I hope to make a Portuguese friend and have a basic understanding of Python and R and be able to use numpy and beaver. I hope to learn a lot because I have no coding experience whatsoever. I am also hoping to learn some Portuguese. Can't wait to explore!
