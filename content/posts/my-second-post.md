The first project I have completed here in Lisbon includes the blog you are currently reading and the poker game in this <a href="https://github.com/ix-ds-lisbon-s1-2019/week-1-project-gpetrosini.git"> repo </a>. To write the code for this poker game I needed to understand two topics that I had lots of trouble with: classes and functions. With lots of help from Manuel, Brad, Genc, and my classmates I was finally able to create a poker game that works! Though it doesn't take the suits into account, I am very proud of my project. I am excited to create more using the programming languages and packages we use in class and am looking forward to the internship projects.
