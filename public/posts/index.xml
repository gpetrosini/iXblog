      <description>The first project I have completed here in Lisbon includes the blog you are currently reading and the poker game in this repo . To write the code for this poker game I needed to understand two topics that I had lots of trouble with: classes and functions. With lots of help from Manuel, Brad, Genc, and my classmates I was finally able to create a poker game that works! Though it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take the suits into account, I am very proud of my project.</description>

      <description>I am so excited to be in Lisbon. By the end of my 6 weeks I hope to make a Portuguese friend and have a basic understanding of Python and R and be able to use numpy and beaver. I hope to learn a lot because I have no coding experience whatsoever. I am also hoping to learn some Portuguese. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to explore!</description>
